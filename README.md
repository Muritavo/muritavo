My contribuitions to the OpenSource world:
[Improving the storybook typing detection when working with typescript generics](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-docgen-typescript/pull/318)
[Fixing a bug that occured only on Android on the core foundation of React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/21884)

Some projects I'm proud of:
[Experienced and constantly evolving my own set of webpack configuration. The highlight here is that every implementation is associated with a requirement that is tested](https://github.com/Muritavo/webpack-microfrontend-scripts)
[Built a simple CLI for creating components. The highlight here is that I'm using the Typescript Core Compiler for guaranteeing that every possible combination works](https://github.com/Muritavo/react-mini-toolkit)
